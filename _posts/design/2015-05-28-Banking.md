For 11 years we were (and whole team of course) responsible for development of electronic banking apps. A lot of Java and C/C++ code, we changed app from EJB/JSP to Apache Wicket Framework and later to AngularJS. We were in mobile banking apps projects, tring to reuse our code base with other software house. We were pionieers of hybrid apps (<b>Ionic framework</b>) for better CX and faster/better software delivery.
