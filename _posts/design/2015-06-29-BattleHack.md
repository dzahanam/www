We make Simplicity app using BrainTree API for easy voice payments. It was our idea to develope app for people with problem using standard smartphone interface.

We prepared our app for people:
<ul>
 <li>visually impaired</li>
 <li>car drivers or in other situation when you can speak but not touch ;)</li>
</ul>
